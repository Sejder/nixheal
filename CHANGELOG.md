# Changelog

## Unreleased

Fixes from a sixth review and a fourth review of the command line:

- A lock only counts as last good together with the pins it built with, which
  are now kept next to it. A package that fails again is pinned to the
  revision that worked, also after its pin was cleared or a run's uncommitted
  changes were thrown away; before, it could be pinned to a revision where it
  was broken too, and this machine's runs gave up until upstream fixed it.
- New `nixheal retry ATTR` queues a retry of a pin nixheal made (shown as
  "retry queued" in `status`); `nixheal clear ATTR` (and `unpin`) removes a
  pin, as its name says. `clear --drop` is gone.
- An unreadable `pins.json` is an error instead of being removed by the
  restore, and a restore no longer stages the deletion of a tracked
  `pins.json`.
- A switcher that fails is reported, and exits with 4 instead of 1.
- `--timeout` (and `autoUpgrade.timeout`) stops updating and building only;
  activation is never cut short. The timers no longer set `TimeoutStartSec`.
- An interrupt waits for nix to exit before restoring, and a panic restores
  too.
- Pinned nixpkgs are imported without the user's own overlays, so
  `~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays` cannot reach them under `--impure`.
- `merge` keeps the local entry on a tie, so a local `clear` or `retry` is not
  undone; `write_atomic` writes through a symlinked `pins.json`; a pin kept on
  retry records the current failure.
- Messages: hold reasons say why there is no older revision to pin to, a pin
  in several sets shows each set's revision when they differ, dry runs no
  longer print created, added and restored lines, `pin` defaults to the
  target's own input, `merge` of a `flake.lock` says so, the exit codes in
  `build --help` and `switch --help` differ, the no-config error says that
  hosts or homes must be set, `status` shows each pin's revision and lists
  the next commands on separate lines.

## 0.1.2

Fixes from four more independent reviews of 0.1.1 and three reviews of its
command line.

Breaking: nixheal no longer commits by default. `build`, `switch` and `boot`
leave `flake.lock` and `pins.json` changed in the checkout unless given
`--commit` or `programs.nixheal.commit = true`; `--no-commit` still turns it
off. `autoUpgrade.commit` defaults to `null`, which follows
`programs.nixheal.commit`, so a timer that should keep committing needs one of
the two set.

Failures:

- A configuration that no longer evaluates, such as one using a removed NixOS
  option, holds that host instead of stopping the run.
- A package nixpkgs refuses to evaluate as insecure, unfree or unsupported
  holds the host instead of being pinned around; a package marked broken is
  still pinned.
- A build killed by a signal, or a failed download that is not a hash
  mismatch, is retried once, and a signal counts as infrastructure rather than
  a broken package.
- Derivations are matched to versioned attributes such as `nodejs_22`.
- Derivation paths are recognised in any store directory.

Setups:

- A flake in a subdirectory of its git repository works; `pinsFile` is the
  `pins.json` next to `flake.lock`, and the run lock lives in the git directory.
- Home Manager inside NixOS takes its entry name from the host's
  `programs.nixheal.name` and its input from the host's
  `programs.nixheal.input`.
- Home Manager with `nixpkgs.config = null`, and NixOS with `nixpkgs.pkgs`
  set, no longer break the overlay.
- Extra package sets and pinned packages are imported for the right platforms
  when cross-compiling.
- The timers set `NIXHEAL_CONFIG`, so they read the settings of the module
  that defined them. The Home Manager timer has git and ssh on its PATH and
  requires `flake`.
- New `autoUpgrade.onFailure`, units to start when a run fails.
- nh is installed when it is the switcher and `programs.nh` is off.
- `nixheal pin` pins in `programs.nixheal.input` unless `--input` says
  otherwise.

Robustness:

- `pin`, `clear` and `merge` take the run lock and check the flake path like
  the build commands.
- A signal can no longer land between writing `pins.json` and restoring it, or
  between the commit and the end of guarding, and an error after the build
  (GC roots, the commit) restores both files.
- Commits run with `core.hooksPath=/dev/null`, so no hook can run.
- A flake path containing `#` or `?` is refused.
- `--gc-roots` removes the roots of targets no longer configured.
- `--quiet` keeps nix's own error messages.
- Journal output is detected by the inode in `JOURNAL_STREAM`, so a run piped
  from a service still prints plainly.

Pins, holds and roots:

- `--gc-roots` only removes roots it made: they are named
  `nixheal-host-NAME` and `nixheal-home-NAME`, so a host and a home can no
  longer share one, and other links in the directory are left alone. Roots
  under the old names are not removed; delete them once by hand.
- The Home Manager timer is kept running through the switch it starts
  (`X-SwitchMethod = keep-old`), and the NixOS one is not stopped when an
  activation drops it (`X-StopOnRemoval = false`).
- The cap on dependents counts every package above the one to pin, not only
  top-level attributes, so a library many `python3Packages` use is not pinned.
- After a failed build, a system counts as built only if it is in the store,
  and older Nix's "N dependencies of derivation ... failed to build", timeout
  and signal messages are understood.
- A host or home that is not in the flake is an error before anything builds,
  instead of being held.
- A build that fails without naming a derivation stops the run instead of
  holding every other host.
- A system that built in an early round is evaluated again with the final
  `pins.json`, and built again if that changed it.
- The evaluation trace is read in full when a failure inside a nested package
  needs the package that uses it.
- `merge` refuses a missing file and one that is not a pins file; every
  command that writes refuses a directory without `flake.lock`.

Command line:

- Every command that writes says which flake and config it acts on. An
  explicit `--config` or `$NIXHEAL_CONFIG` that cannot be read is an error.
- `--config`, `--flake` and `-q` work before or after the command, under their
  own help heading; every flag and argument has help text, and help wraps.
- `--update` with an input the flake does not have is an error.
- `pin`, `clear` and `clear --held` say what happens next and how to undo
  them; `pin` says when it replaces an existing pin, and `clear --held` no
  longer takes an attribute.
- Holds and give-ups say what to do; a host held before is "still" held.
- Dry runs mark their changes `(dry run)` instead of reporting them twice.
- A run ends with one line of what it built, pinned, unpinned and held, and
  what it committed. Short rounds and fresh pins are reported more quietly.
- `--quiet` holds back nix's error messages unless nixheal could not handle
  them, and without it handled errors are followed by a line saying so.
- `status` prints an aligned table with a header and a summary, names the
  flake, and says when there is no `pins.json`. `status --json` rows carry
  `target`, `target_kind`, `inputs`, `attr`, `since` and `held_reason`.
- `why` says where else a package is pinned and how to clear it.
- Error messages name where a path came from, cut nix's errors to the line
  that says what failed, and avoid store paths where a name will do.
- `--max-rounds 0` is refused.

Package sets:

- A package several package sets provide as the same derivation is one
  failure: it is pinned in every set that can take the pin (a set that did
  not move, or is new in the lock, is skipped instead of holding the host),
  counts once against `--max-new-pins`, is retried and released as a group,
  and is never reported "builds again" while a sibling pin still carries it.
  `status`, `why`, `status --json` and the logs show it once, with its sets.
- An evaluation failure is pinned in every set that lost the attribute, not
  only the first.
- Pinned packages and extra package sets are imported for the right build
  and host platforms, so `pkgsStatic` and cross builds keep them.

Runs:

- A build that cannot run here (another platform, no builder, out of memory)
  holds only the hosts that need it; this machine's own is given up on.
- A held entry records the lock hash of the lock it is held on.
- An interrupt stops the running nix too, and no write lands after the
  restore.
- The Home Manager `autoUpgrade` with no `homes` is an error, as on NixOS.
- New `autoUpgrade.timeout` (12h) stops a stuck run.
- `--gc-roots` lists the roots each flake made, and refuses a second flake
  rooting a target of the same name in one directory.
- `merge` keeps pins made by hand here that the incoming entry lacks.
- A read-only nixpkgs (`readOnlyPkgs`) gets a warning instead of an error.
- New `--fail-on-hold`, exiting with 3 when something is held.
- Pins of evaluation failures keep nix's error, and `why` shows it.

More command line:

- `pin`, `why` and `clear` refuse a `--host` or `--home` that is not
  configured.
- The closing line says when nothing changed instead of claiming uncommitted
  files, and a commit's title follows whether `flake.lock` changed.
- Holds say how to release them; `status` ends with what to run next.
- Pin lines name the package, its sets, the revision's date and what failed.
- Per-pin age lines are gone below `warnAfterDays`.
- `build --help` groups fleet and tuning options; `-u` for `--update`,
  `unpin` for `clear`, `-v`/`--verbose` to override `quiet`, `--only a,b`.
- `clear` with no argument says `<ATTR|--held>`.
- Errors about a config file say where its path came from, and the config's
  JSON format is documented.
- `status --json` names targets `host NAME` and `home NAME`, `pins` counts
  packages, and rows carry `inputs`.

Fifth review:

- `nixheal clear` on a pin nixheal made no longer throws the old revision
  away: the next run retries the package, dropping the pin if it builds and
  keeping it at its revision if it still fails. `--drop` removes it outright,
  and says what that means. `nixheal pin --old-lock FILE` pins at the input's
  revision in another `flake.lock`.
- The read-only nixpkgs check works (`readOnlyPkgs` declares
  `nixpkgs.overlays` itself), with a flake check.
- Pinned packages keep musl, `gcc.arch`, LLVM and other plain platform
  settings: a platform that is not the default for its system is passed as
  its triple plus the settings that differ, never as an elaborated platform,
  which an older nixpkgs cannot take. Checks cover glibc, musl, static, LLVM,
  a tuned `gcc.arch` and a cross build.
- `--gc-roots` keeps a held host's root on its list, so it is pruned once the
  host is no longer configured.
- Every error after a run starts restores `flake.lock` and `pins.json`
  (including a missing `--old-lock` on a fresh checkout), the error comes
  first and the restore is reported only when something changed, and a dry
  run or failed run takes a `pins.json` it added out of the git index.
- `nix flake update` is stopped with nixheal, and its output is held back
  under `--quiet` unless it fails.
- A hold that `merge` sees is ranked by the lock it was tried against
  (`checkedLastModified`), so a newer hold is not lost.
- A system that embeds `pins.json` by itself is built again with the final
  file too.
- Once this machine's own host fails, the run stops instead of building the
  others for nothing.
- `autoUpgrade` without `enable` is an error; `--dry-run` honours
  `--fail-on-hold`; `--only host:NAME` and `home:NAME` tell a host and a home
  apart.
- Messages: the hint for a package pinned on this machine's own entry, the
  "not pinning" reasons, a closing line that says "nothing pinned or
  unpinned" and "uncommitted changes" (shown under `--quiet` too), `why` on a
  held host, `clear --input` with the wrong set, pins dropped when their host
  is held, "held" for homes, hints that do not repeat the flag you passed,
  one `attr (sets)` form, a warning when `switch` activates nothing, exit
  codes in `--help`, real plurals, and "today".
- The README says that `pins.json` is code to review and only merge from a
  trusted build host.

## 0.1.1

Fixes from an independent review of 0.1.0.

Setups where pins silently never applied are now caught before anything
builds, with an error saying what to change:

- `programs.nixheal.name` must be the configuration's name: a host whose name
  differs (for example `networking.hostName = "alice-laptop"` on
  `nixosConfigurations.laptop`, or `homeConfigurations."alice@laptop"`) wrote
  its pins under one name and read them under another.
- `pinsFile` must be the `pins.json` at the flake root, where nixheal writes
  it, and a path rather than a string.
- `programs.nixheal.enable` must be on in every target.
- New `programs.nixheal.input`, for a main nixpkgs input not called `nixpkgs`.

Bugs:

- Fixed-output hash mismatches are recognised as build failures, so a broken download
  is pinned instead of failing every host in the round. Only hosts whose own
  build failed are affected by an unrecognised failure.
- Builds that cannot run here (another platform, no builder, a timeout, out of
  memory) stop the run without pinning or holding anything.
- `switch` and `boot` with `--hold-local` no longer activate a held local host.
- Each target uses its own package sets, read from its configuration, instead
  of the running machine's.
- The last good lock is kept per target, and saved only after the commit.
- A run writes the entries it built, instead of keeping a stale entry when the
  lock moved backwards.
- A run takes a lock on the flake, and Ctrl-C or SIGTERM restores `flake.lock`
  and `pins.json`.
- `--dry-run` leaves `--built-link` and a fresh checkout alone.
- `boot` on a Home Manager configuration is refused before building.
- `--only` with an unknown name is an error.
- `nixheal pin` checks that the package exists.
- Host names are quoted in attribute paths.
- Packages more than 25 others depend on are no longer pinned, since that
  rebuilt all of them from source; the host is held instead.

Safety:

- `autoUpgrade.user` is required, and nixheal refuses to run as root in a
  checkout another user owns, which left root-owned files there. Files are
  written through exclusively created temporary files that keep the original
  owner and mode, so a planted symlink is never followed.
- Commits skip git hooks and signing, so a hook or a GPG prompt cannot stall
  the timer. When git refuses a repository, nixheal says so.
- The root activation step only activates a NixOS system in the store, and
  `--built-link` is a GC root.
- The NixOS timer has ssh available for `git+ssh` inputs; the Home Manager
  timer drops a dependency the user manager cannot satisfy.
- `argName` cannot shadow a module argument such as `pkgs`.
- Home Manager inside NixOS warns when `hosts`, `homes` or `autoUpgrade` are
  set there, since they only apply standalone.
- A flake path inside the Nix store is refused.

Smaller changes:

- `homeModules.default` is exported next to `homeManagerModules.default`.
- `status` marks old pins and holds `STALE`, as the JSON does, and manual pins
  never go stale. Homes are named `home NAME` in the summary. Dates are local.
- The README documents every flag, the exit codes, the config lookup order, the
  three requirements above and the overlay's precedence.
- Tests cover the Home Manager module, the activation step, the new log
  formats, the probes, the dry run, holds without activation and interruption.
  CI lints test code too.

## 0.1.0

First public release.

- `nixheal build`, `switch` and `boot`, each with `--update [INPUT...]`:
  update the flake, build every configured host and home, pin packages that
  fail to the nixpkgs they last built with, unpin them once they build again,
  hold hosts pinning cannot fix, commit `flake.lock` and `pins.json`, and
  activate with nh, nixos-rebuild or home-manager.
- `nixheal status [--json]`, `why`, `pin`, `clear` and `merge`.
- NixOS and Home Manager modules (`programs.nixheal`) that apply the pins to
  `pkgs` and to further nixpkgs imports, write the settings to
  `/etc/nixheal.json` or `~/.config/nixheal.json`, and provide
  `autoUpgrade`, a timer in place of `system.autoUpgrade`.
- Fleet support: `--hold-local`, `--gc-roots` and `--built-link`, per-host
  entries in `pins.json` (format version 2) with the lock each was computed
  for, and `merge` with newer-lock-wins.
- `pins.json` format version 2 is stable from this release on.
